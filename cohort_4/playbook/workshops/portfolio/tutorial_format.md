# How the rest of this tutorial will work.

## Order of Operations

1. We will focus building the data layer in HTML
2. Then we will styling our data layer with CSS

## Primary objective: Learning to Google

Instead of telling you all the answers in our tutorials, we want to show you how you can disover many of the answer for yourself using Google. We do this so that after hack camp, you will still be able to figure out how to do things that you don't know how to do without your peers and facillitators around.

Know that using  Google this will probably be at least a bit more frustrating than if we always just told you the answer, but will pay off in the longer term.

Good thing Googling will be part of your rest of your programming career. Don't just take it from me:
