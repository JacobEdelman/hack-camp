# Description Challenge

## Prompt

We need to figure out how to add a description.

```html
<!-- PORTFOLIO -->

  <!-- IMAGE SECTION -->
    - image
  
  <!-- INFORMATION SECTION -->
    <h1>Jonathan Leung</h1> 
    - description <!--================== [Next] -->

  <!-- SOCIAL MEDIA SECTION -->
    - link to Facebook
    - link to Twitter
    - link to Github
```

## The Question

At this point, you know you're supposed to google, but you have no idea what!

So you ask the facillitator:

> In my html file,  I want to add a description underneath of the `h1` tag. How do I do that?

I may respond

> Use a paragraph tag! Google will tell you how to use it.
