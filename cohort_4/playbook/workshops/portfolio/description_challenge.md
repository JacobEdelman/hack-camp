# Challenge: Adding the description

## Prompt

We need to figure out how to add a description.

```html
<!-- PORTFOLIO -->

  <!-- IMAGE SECTION -->
    - http://i.imgur.com/vS0HhER.jpg 
  
  <!-- INFORMATION SECTION -->
    <h1>Jonathan Leung</h1>
    - I want show people that the world is malleable. I want them to know they can create what's missing and not be afraid to break the status quo.
    <!-- NEXT -->

  <!-- SOCIAL MEDIA SECTION -->
    - link to Facebook (https://twitter.com/jonathanjleung)
    - link to Twitter (https://twitter.com/jonathanjleung)
    - link to Github (https://github.com/jonleung)
```

## Asking for Help

At this point, you know you're supposed to google, but you have no idea what!

So you ask the facillitator:

> I want to add a description underneath of the `h1` tag. How do I do that?

The facillitator may respond:

> Use a paragraph tag! Google will tell you how to use it.
