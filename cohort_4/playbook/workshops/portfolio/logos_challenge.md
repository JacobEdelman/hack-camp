Below are some tips for googling:

## Potential Google Scoping
Here are a listing of Google queries sorted from the top down from worst to best.

- `html how do you add logos to your website`
    - Problem: Well, this isn't what exactly what you're looking for. You're just trying to add an image instead of text in a link
- `html how do you link to an image instead of text`
    - Problem: `instead of text` will only narrow your search to websites that mention `instead of text` but you don't actually care if they say this or not. All you want is `how do you link to an image`
- `html how do you link to an image`
    - Problem: the words `how do you` and `an` are extraneous. Google doesn't really care about them.
- `html link to image`
    - Awesome.

## Note

For any image that you want to add to your website, you can always upload them imgur.com and link to the images directly.
