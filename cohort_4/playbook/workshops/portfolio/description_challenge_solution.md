## How I Googled

TODO: Insert how you google searched here

- `how do you add a paragraph tag`
    - Problem: you did not indicate that you wanted to add a header in `html`
- `how do you add a paragraph tag in html`
    - Problem: you get better results if you put the topic in the front
- `html how do you add a paragraph tag`
    - Problem: the words `how do you` and `a` are extraneous. Google doesn't really care about them.
- `html add paragraph tag`
    - Awesome.
