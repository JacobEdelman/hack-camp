# Creating Our Files & Folders

## Creating the project folder

For each project that we work on, we want to create a new folder for it.

We are creating a new portfolio website so lets make a new folder for our project named `portfolio`

- On the left file pane, right click and click `New Folder` to create a new
folder.
- Name it `portfolio`.
