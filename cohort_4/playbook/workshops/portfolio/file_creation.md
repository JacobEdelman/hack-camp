# Creating your project files

## Creating the project folder

For each project that we work on, we want to create a new folder for it.

We are creating a new portfolio website so lets make a new folder for our project named `portfolio`

- On the left file pane, right click and click `New Folder` to create a new
folder.
- Name it `portfolio`.

- right click on the `portfolio` folder
- click `New File`
- name it `index.html`
- double click it to open it

## The scaffold of every html page:

Type the following code into the open file.

Replace Zaphod's name with your own name.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Zaphod's Portfolio</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Zaphod Beeblebrox</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

```md
Pro-tip!

  " "

When trying to learn something new, don't copy and paste code or else
you won't remember it as well

Also, make sure you keep the same indentation that we do.
