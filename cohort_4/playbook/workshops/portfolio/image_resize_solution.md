# Solution: Resizing the image

To recap, we want to resize the images to make them smaller.

## Googling the solution

- I Google `css resize image`

    > ![](img/google_css_resize_image.png)

- I see that the first result is from Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is an extremely popular question and answer service used by 
programmers. If you see it in your Google search results, definitely check it out.

An Aside!

༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

At this point, I, Jonathan, the writer of this tutorial who is trying to show you that you can Google your way to the answer, was unable to find a way for a beginner to make a search query along the lines of `css resize image` that would yield results that would both (1) work and that (2) you would understand.

If you were to have gone through the first 3 results in the Google query, you most likely 

(1) would not have understood them
(2) they would not have worked
(3) they used inline styles which is bad

Say you had embarked on the journey as mentioned.

After about 4-8 minutes, you should ask for help, from one of your peers and then if they didn't know, one of your facillitators.

٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶

Let's say you asked your facillitators for help now.

The way you would do it is:

    "Hey Jonathan, I'm trying to resize the image and googled `css resize image`. I looked through the first 3 Google results but they either did not work or did not make sense to me. I asked Rebecca already but she didn't know either. What should I do"

This shows that you have tried on your own which means
- you are gaining the skill of being able to learn things with Google on your own
- you have asked at least one peer which increases the comfort level that you will ask your peers after you graduate from hack camp
- therefore, at this point, we would be more than happy to guide you through this part.

Yes you could go and google "css basics" and read up on that but that would take more than 2 hours and we're trying to give you a base as quickly as possible.

## Trying some CSS code

The answers provided by the Stack Overflow page are not wrong, we just don't quite understand CSS yet.

```css
img {
    width: 200px;
}
```

Let's see what this does:

> ![](img/image_resize.png)

Well, we definitely changed the size of the images!
