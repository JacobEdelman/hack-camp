- Adding more content
  - We previously used an `h1` tag to create a heading in our website.
    Headings are a way to order the content in the `body`. We can use the `h1`
    to `h6` tags to define them. `h1` is the "most important", and then these
    tags gradually become "less important" until you reach `h6`, the "least
    important".

    ```html
    <h1>The Onion</h1>
    <h2>Posts</h2>
    <h3>Son-Of-A-Gun Mouse Solves Maze Researchers Spent Months Building</h3>
    <h3>Informal Tone Of Cover Letter Sets Job Applicant Apart From Seriously
    Considered Candidates</h3>
    <h2>More Heading Examples</h2>
    <h3>A Heading</h3>
    <h4>A Heading</h4>
    <h5>A Heading</h5>
    <h6>A Heading</h6>
    ```

  - **Challenge time:** we previously used an `h1` tag inside of the `body`
    tag to create a heading with our name on our webpage. Create a smaller
    heading to put the projects we create under. Here's what it should look
    like:
